# head-controlled-mouse

Use your head to control the mouse.

1. Run `node server.js`.

2. Use your mobile browser that has an orientation sensor and open the web page.

    - Click “Keep awake” button to go into full screen mode and prevent the screen from sleeping.

      (You must enable “Experimental Web Platform” features in `chrome://flags`).

    - Click “Calibrate” to calibrate the sensor values after 5 seconds delay.

To adjust sensitivity, edit server.js (right now, the number is hardcoded)


## Demo

I built this project in a live coding streaming session.

You can see the first working demo at 22:50 into the video, and the last demo with calibration function at 30:50 into the video.
